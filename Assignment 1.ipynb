Integer and floating points are seperated by decimal points. 5 is an int and 5.0 is a float. Complex numbers are represented by complex class and written as (real part) + (imaginary part)j. Eg: 5 + 4j  \n",

We can use slicing operator [] to access an item or range of items in the list. They are mutable i.e. they can be modified later. Eg: list = [5,'python',6.7]. While tuples are also ordered collection of items just as a list. The only difference is that they are immutable i.e. they cannot be modified once created. We can use slicing operator to extract data but cannot change it. Eg: tuple = (4.0, 'jack', 6+2j).  \n",
